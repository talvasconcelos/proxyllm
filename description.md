Monetize your AI â€” sell secure, prepaid access to local or remote language models (LLMs) using Bitcoin over the Lightning Network.

ProxyLLM is a proxy layer for AI agents. Clients can register LLMs (like OpenAI, Groq, or local models) and set their price, while users can discover and pay for access to available agents directly through Lightning. All credentials remain private, and payments are made upfront to unlock usage time, requests, or tasks.
